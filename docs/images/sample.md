 "Just wanted to let you know that Friflo ECS 2.0.0 works like a charm in my little game.<br/>
I use it for basically everything (landscape segments, vegetation, players, animations, collisions and even the floating dust particles are entities).<br/>
After some optimization there is no object allocation during gameplay - the allocation graph just stays flat - no garbage collection"
